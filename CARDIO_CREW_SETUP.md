# Cardio Crew Feature Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up the Cardio Crew feature in your J&E Fitness app.

## ðŸ”§ Required Database Rules Update

The Cardio Crew feature requires updated Firebase Realtime Database rules to allow users to see other users' basic information.

### Step 1: Update Database Rules

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Realtime Database** â†’ **Rules** tab
4. Replace the current rules with:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "users": {
      ".read": "auth != null",
      "$uid": {
        ".read": "$uid === auth.uid",
        ".write": "$uid === auth.uid"
      }
    },
    "usernames": {
      ".read": "auth != null",
      ".write": "auth != null"
    },
    "test": {
      ".read": true,
      ".write": true
    }
  }
}
```

5. Click **"Publish"**

### Step 2: Test the Feature

1. **Log in** to your app
2. Click **"ðŸ”§ Test Firebase & Cardio Crew"** button
3. Click **"ðŸ§ª Run All Tests"**
4. Check that **"Get All Users"** test passes âœ…

### Step 3: Verify Cardio Crew Works

1. **Create a second test account** (different username)
2. **Log back in** with your first account
3. **Go to Dashboard** â†’ **"ðŸ’ª Cardio Crew"**
4. You should now see the second user in the "Discover Athletes" section

## ðŸ”’ Security Explanation

The updated rules provide:

- **Basic user info readable by all authenticated users** (needed for Cardio Crew)
- **Detailed user data protected** (only readable by the user themselves)
- **Username mappings accessible** (needed for authentication)

**What users can see about others:**
- Username
- Current streak
- Total workouts
- Account creation date

**What remains private:**
- Email address
- Workout history details
- Personal notes
- Custom workouts

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### "No other users found" error

**Possible causes:**
1. **Database rules not updated** - Follow Step 1 above
2. **No other users exist** - Create a second test account
3. **Permission denied error** - Check browser console for details

**Debug steps:**
1. Use the **"ðŸ”§ Test Firebase & Cardio Crew"** button
2. Check browser console (F12) for error messages
3. Verify database rules are published correctly
4. Ensure you're logged in when testing

### "Database permission denied" error

This means the database rules need to be updated. The current rules only allow users to read their own data, but Cardio Crew needs to read basic info about all users.

**Solution:** Update the rules as shown in Step 1 above.

### "Failed to update avatar" error

This error occurs when trying to change your emoji avatar.

**Possible causes:**
1. **Database rules not updated** - Follow Step 1 above
2. **User profile missing** - Try logging out and back in
3. **Network connectivity issues** - Check your internet connection

**Debug steps:**
1. **Check browser console** (F12) for detailed error messages
2. **Verify you're logged in** - Make sure you're authenticated
3. **Try logging out and back in** - This refreshes your user session
4. **Check database rules** - Ensure they allow writing to user data
5. **Use the Firebase Test tool** - Click "ðŸ”§ Test Firebase & Cardio Crew" to run diagnostics

**Quick fix:** If the error persists, try logging out and logging back in to refresh your authentication session.
